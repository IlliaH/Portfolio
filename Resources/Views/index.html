                    During my time at Bidvine I had the opportunity to grow as a developer, I was responsible for the development, maintenance of iOS applications, and their integration with back-end services. I worked alongside other engineers developing different layers of the applications.  I was involved in the process of converting the entire pro app from MVC to MVVM, rewriting a customer app, and creating sophisticated design.

                Quit smoke app is designed to help people cut down smoking. It has some paid content, which becomes available after purchasing weekly subscription, so managing global app state properly was essential. While working on this app I sharpened my skills at reactive programming, got familiar with in app purchases, and submitted an app to AppStore.
