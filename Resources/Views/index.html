                    <span>Insights screen shows professional’s statistics based on different data that Bidvine collected. I was responsible for rebuilding the entire screen and this is what this task involved:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>showing web views while keeping users logged in</li>
                        <li>laying out inline content, taking into consideration the fact that values can be multiline</li>
                        <li>performing service sorting without experiencing table view glitches</li>
                        <li>redirecting users to other view controllers</li>
                        <li>working with attributed string to achieve colored text</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>Old codebase wasn’t scalable as view controller basically contained all code, had memory leaks, was gigantic, and slow. After rebuilding the screen, we were able to extend functionality easily.</span>

                    <span>Bid Insights feature showed the comparison between a current professional and other people who submitted a bid. Also, it was designed to be paid feature, as a result I had to handle different screen states. The existing code was beyond any repair. There were some difficulties that I encountered while implementing this screen:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>some parts of text were tappable, so I had to come up with custom UI component as iOS doesn’t support it by default</li>
                        <li>to avoid duplicated code, I wrote generic code for Summary tab as those sections had a lot in common.</li>
                        <li>Professionals, who didn’t have this feature had an ability to go to the web payment screen to purchase it and after closing web view, changes were applied to UI.</li>
                        <li>Timeline tab had complex UI as there were components, which must be aligned horizontally and vertically to display information properly.</li>
                        <li>I had to read React Native code to understand all requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>Overall, implementing this screen gave me significant knowledge and techniques. I learned how to efficiently break big task down into small subtasks to achieve desired goal.</span>
